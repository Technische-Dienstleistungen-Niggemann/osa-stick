# osa-stick
This project is currently just an attempt to offer an inexpensive and modular arcade stick as open source that anyone can assemble at home and adapt to their needs. 
I develop everything in my free time and use my own money for it without any financial interests. 
Therefore, I do not give any guarantees and ask for your understanding if something is not absolutely perfect.

My goal is to create a modifiable arcade stick that is affordable and can compete with the best on the market. 
This goal is very ambitious and requires a lot of testing, a lot of time and a lot of patience.

If you like my project, you are welcome to donate some money or hardware to support further development.

This project is a part of my [controller](https://www.multi-console-controller.com/) project and if you have ideas for improving this joystick, please contact me ðŸ™‚
